pogoplug-v3
===========
It's the kernel sourecode for pogoplug v3 .
I forked it based on http://pogoplug.com/opensource#PRO (pogopro-linux-2.6.31.6-r2.tar.bz2).

Basically, I make it as a replacement for the uImage in archlinux pogoplug-v3 usb booting solution
(See  http://archlinuxarm.org/platforms/armv6/pogoplug-v3oxnas-eol).

And I patched tempfs and so on. 
For details, please check the commit log~
